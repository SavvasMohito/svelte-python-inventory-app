# svelte-python-inventory-app

This project is a simple inventory web application with features including:
* User Authentication
* Inventory management via CRUD operations
* Separate items per user
* Modern front-end design

The code is distributed in two main directories, each with its own README explaining how they work.
1. [/frontend](./frontnend): Contains all of the frontend code, dependencies and README
2. [/backend](./backend): Contains all of the backend code dependencies and README
3. [/charts](./charts): Includes the helm charts for deploying the project on Kubernetes

This application was developed by following the microservices architecture, meaning each component gets deployed separately as a docker container. The configuration of each one can be viewed in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.

To run the project locally using docker, clone the repository and run `docker compose up -d --build` from the root directory. Everything should be automatically installed and launched. The only requirement is for the .env file to be created and populated, as shown in the .env.example template file.
